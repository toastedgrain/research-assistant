"""Caption-anchored figure and table region detection.

This is the primary backend, not a fallback (plan deviation 2): PDFFigures2 needs a JVM
and Docling pulls multi-GB torch models, neither of which fits the budget. Working from
PyMuPDF's vector-drawing and image data also handles TikZ-drawn figures, which spec D2
calls out as the common case in ML papers.

The shape of the heuristic:

    caption anchor  ->  search the band on the caption's content side
                    ->  cluster graphics/rows separated by less than a line gap
                    ->  absorb text that sits inside the cluster (axis labels)
                    ->  reject anything degenerate

Rejection is a feature. Spec section 11 wants precision over recall everywhere: a caption
with no defensible region produces a warning and no asset, never an empty crop.
