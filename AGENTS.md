# Marginalia — figure-first paper reader

## What this is

A PDF reader for arXiv AI/ML papers that keeps figures, tables, and references visible next
to the text that references them. A sentence on page 3 says "as shown in Figure 1"; Figure 1
is on page 7. This tool resolves that in place so the reader never loses their sentence.

**It does not summarize.** See `PROJECT_SPEC_1.md` §2 — the non-goals are load-bearing, not
placeholders. The target user reads papers in full and is the least LLM-error-tolerant
audience that exists; one wrong generated claim and they churn permanently.

**Design rule:** a feature that *invents* text is off by default and clearly labeled. A
feature that *relocates* text already in the paper can be on by default.

**Optional local generation now exists, but it is never authoritative.** User-triggered
Visualize, Play, evidence-graph candidate, tension-inspection, and investigator actions pass
bounded verified `SourceEvidence` through a provider-neutral server boundary. Structured
output is schema-validated, source-ID-validated, visibly labelled generated/inferred, and
fails closed or falls back to deterministic source views. Core reading remains fully usable
when the provider is disabled or unavailable. Do not add automatic paper summaries or let
model output redefine literal source relationships.

## Status

All eight phases of `SHIP_PLAN.md` are built and the loop runs end to end: paste an arXiv
id, read the paper, click a figure mention, get the figure in place.

- **Extraction** (`apps/api/extract/`) — figures, tables, crops, captions, sections,
  references, arXiv resolution. CLI: `uv run python -m extract paper.pdf`.
- **API** (`apps/api/main.py`) — upload/arXiv ingest, manifest, blob store.
- **Reader** (`apps/web/`) — pdf.js viewer, hotspots, overlay cards, reverse links,
  side-by-side citations, outline, keyboard, dark mode, auto-dock.
- **Eval** (`eval/`) — figure coverage and timing in Python, mentions in Node.

Verified on *Attention Is All You Need*, *ResNet* and *BERT*: 5/5, 7/7 and 3/5 figures;
4/4, 14/14 and 6/8 tables. Everything not detected is dropped with a warning and renders
no affordance.

**Known gaps, in priority order.** Figure-region IoU and caption-attachment accuracy are
unmeasured — there are no hand-labelled bounding boxes, and `eval/` reports that as
UNMEASURED rather than inventing a number. Mention precision/recall are measured on two
labelled pages of one paper, which is a smoke test with a percentage attached, not the
30-paper golden set spec §11 asks for. Verified evidence pins, evidence chains, collections,
board state, generated-artifact caches, and learning progress now persist through IndexedDB;
product metrics remain uninstrumented. `STAGE_6_INTEGRATION_ACCEPTANCE.md` is the current expansion status and records the browser
acceptance gate separately from automated verification.

Two source-of-truth documents:

- `PROJECT_SPEC_1.md` — the full product spec (M0→M5). Owns *why*.
- `SHIP_PLAN.md` — the approved 30-hour ship plan. Owns *what we're actually building
  now*. **Read this before starting work.**

The plan deliberately deviates from the spec in three places, all agreed with the user.
Do not "fix" the code back toward the spec without checking the plan first:

1. **Overlay, not dock rail.** Spec §8's three-column layout is replaced by draggable
   translucent cards floating over the PDF. Clicking a citation opens the cited paper
   **side-by-side** in a second pane.
2. **Mention detection is client-side.** Spec §6 Stage 5 (shared Python/TS text
   normalization contract) is deleted — the spec authorizes this escape hatch itself. See
   Architecture below.
3. **Caption-anchored heuristic is the primary figure backend**, not the fallback.
   PDFFigures2 needs a JVM and `java` is not installed; Docling pulls multi-GB torch models.

## Stack

- Python 3.12 (pinned via `.python-version`), uv-managed — **not** the system 3.14
- PyMuPDF (`import fitz`) for all PDF work: render, crop, text, vector drawings
- FastAPI, single process, inline extraction with SSE progress — no worker queue
- Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind + `pdfjs-dist` (*planned*)
- **No database.** Filesystem blob store at `data/<sha256>/`
- Local only — no deploy, no accounts, no auth

Spec §9 calls for Postgres + Redis + arq + S3. All cut; the plan documents why.

## Architecture

Extraction runs once per unique PDF, keyed by SHA-256 of its bytes (spec D1 — this is what
makes the unit economics work; the hundredth reader of *Attention Is All You Need* gets an
instant load). Output is a single static JSON manifest. The client is a dumb renderer over
that manifest with no server round-trips while reading (spec D3).

```
arXiv ID / upload → FastAPI → extract/ → data/<sha256>/{paper.pdf, manifest.json, crops/*.png}
                                              ↓
                                    Next.js + pdf.js renders it
```

**The language boundary is the most important thing to understand here:**

| Side | Owns |
|---|---|
| Python | figure/table regions, PNG crops, captions, sections, reference parsing, arXiv resolution |
| TypeScript | mention detection, citation markers, hotspots, reverse index |

The manifest has **no `mentions[]` array**. The client already holds pdf.js
`textContent.items`, so it runs the mention regex over those directly and builds the reverse
index in-browser at load time. This is deliberate: a server-side mention index would require
a byte-identical text-normalization rule on both sides, and keeping two implementations in
two languages in sync is a permanent bug source. Do not add server-side mention detection.

Consequence: mention-accuracy eval runs in Node; figure-region eval runs in Python.

## Folder structure

- `apps/api/` — FastAPI app + the `extract/` package (the extraction pipeline)
- `packages/schema/` — `manifest.schema.json` is the contract between Python and TS; TS types
  are generated from it. Change the schema here first, never in one side only.
- `fixtures/` — golden test papers + hand-labeled ground truth. PDFs are gitignored, labels
  are tracked.
- `eval/` — accuracy harness (spec §11). Exists from M0, not bolted on later.
- `data/` — gitignored blob store, content-hash keyed

## Commands

```bash
# Python deps (run from apps/api)
uv sync

# extraction CLI — the M0 deliverable
uv run python -m extract paper.pdf > manifest.json

# API dev server
uv run fastapi dev

# tests
uv run pytest

# web (planned)
cd apps/web && npm run dev
```

## Conventions

- **Coordinates.** PDF native origin is bottom-left, y up. pdf.js viewport is top-left, y
  down. The manifest stores **normalized top-left `[0,1]`**. Convert exactly once, in
  `extract/geometry.py`. Any coordinate bug in this project will be a failure to convert
  exactly once. The test for this is written *before* the conversion.
- **Precision over recall, everywhere.** When confidence is low, render nothing. A hotspot
  that opens the wrong figure is worse than no hotspot; a tool that silently does less is
  trusted, a tool that is confidently wrong is uninstalled.
- **Never render a dead affordance.** Unmatched mention → keep in manifest with
  `asset_id: null` and log a warning, but no clickable hotspot. Unresolved reference →
  plain text, no open button.
- Schema changes start in `packages/schema/manifest.schema.json`, then regenerate TS types
  with `npm run gen:schema` from `apps/web`. Never edit the generated `manifest.ts`.
- **Core AI contracts name no vendor.** Components depend on
  `LearningGenerationProvider`, not a model SDK. Provider adapters and machine-local env
  configuration may name the selected runtime/model, so they can be swapped without
  rewriting learning or evidence UI. Harness-specific files stay untracked.
- Don't add features not in the spec or the plan. If something seems obviously missing,
  raise it as an open question rather than building it (spec §14).

## Dangerous areas

- **`extract/geometry.py`** — the single coordinate conversion. Double-converting or
  half-converting produces figures that render plausibly but in the wrong place, which is
  hard to spot by eye. Always covered by the top-half-of-page fixture test.
- **Caption self-reference exclusion** — the caption "Figure 1: Overview…" is *not* a mention
  of Figure 1. Without suppression, every figure gets a spurious self-mention and the reverse
  index becomes wrong on every paper.
- **arXiv API** — be polite: identify the client, rate-limit, cache every lookup. Getting
  blocked mid-build costs the deadline.
- **Do not put this repo back in OneDrive.** See below.

## Known edge cases

- **OneDrive breaks Python and Node installs.** This repo previously lived under
  `C:\Users\andzh\OneDrive\...` and uv failed with `os error 396` (hardlink unsupported) and
  `os error 32` (file locked mid-write) because OneDrive syncs files while installers write
  them. `node_modules` would be far worse. The repo was moved to `C:\dev\research-assistant`
  for this reason. Keep it out of synced folders.
- **System Python is 3.14**, which may lack PyMuPDF wheels. The project pins 3.12. If
  `import fitz` fails, check `.python-version` before debugging anything else.
- Mention text hazards, each a real bug report: ranges ("Figures 2–4" → three mentions),
  hyphenation across line breaks ("Fig-\nure 3"), ligatures (`ﬁ` → `fi`), appendix numbering
  ("Figure S3", "Figure A.1") — and appendix figures can **restart numbering**, so a bare
  `(kind, number)` key can collide with a body figure.
- Subfigures: `3a` is a distinct asset with `parent_id: "fig-3"`. If subregion detection
  fails, fall back to the parent crop rather than rendering nothing.
- Dark mode must invert the page canvas but **not** figure crops — inverting a
  white-background plot makes it unreadable and inverting a photo destroys it.

### Learned while building — each of these cost real debugging time

- **Every arXiv PDF stamps `arXiv:NNNN [cs.CL] date` sideways down the left margin at
  20pt**, which beats a 17pt title. Take the largest *horizontal* line only
  (`line["dir"]`), or every paper is titled "arXiv:…".
- **PyMuPDF emits one "line" per table *cell*, not per row.** So a table's columns are
  not gaps inside a line; they are several lines sharing a vertical band. `tabular.py`
  tests both signatures for this reason.
- **Wordy table rows can look like body paragraphs.** Caption-to-body barriers truncated
  Attention Tables 2 and 3 even though the tabular core was detected. Grow a conservative
  edge-aligned row cluster from the verified core and test it on raw real-paper geometry;
  do not globally weaken the body-text barrier.
- **A textual table defeats every word/width/digit heuristic.** Attention's Table 1 is
  one 39-word block, 59% of the page wide, with no digits. Only column structure
  separates it from a paragraph.
- **A synthetic PDF is not a fixture for block-grouping behaviour.** PyMuPDF groups
  hand-built pages differently from LaTeX output; two tests here passed against synthetic
  PDFs while the real paper still failed. Test that logic on raw geometry instead.
- **ACL bibliography lines start with a year** (`2018. Contextual string embeddings…`),
  which parses as a numbered heading and truncates the reference list to one entry.
  Heading numbers are capped at two digits; years are four.
- **Line-break hyphens are often U+2010, not ASCII**, so de-hyphenation must run before
  punctuation folding — or on text that still has its line breaks. Joining lines with a
  space first destroys the signal.
- **The Windows console is cp1252** and cannot encode most author lists (`Łukasz
  Kaiser`). The CLI reconfigures stdout to UTF-8.
- **`"use client"` does not prevent server rendering.** Client components are still
  server-rendered for the initial HTML, and pdf.js touches DOM APIs at import, so the
  reader must be loaded through `dynamic(..., { ssr: false })`.
- **pdf.js 6 requires `canvas` in render params**, not just `canvasContext`.
- **pdf.js often emits a whole line as one text item**, so a hotspot built from its rect
  underlines a whole line. Interpolate across the item by character position.
- **pdf.js omits spaces between items**, leaving word boundaries implied by geometry;
  without inserting them a line flattens to `asshowninFigure1` and nothing matches.
